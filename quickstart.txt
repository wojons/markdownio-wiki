Quick Start
===========

In this tutorial, we will create a very basic website. *No knowledge of HTML or any other complex technologies is required!*.

You start by creating a so called *Markdown file*, which is nothing more than a standard text file (with a .txt ending). You then start to write your content into this file. But since simple text files don't offer any method to provide formating, you use a special markup language called *Markdown*. This is how an example Markdown file may look like:

	Welcome!	
	=======

	Welcome visitor, this is my new website! I utilize *Markdown* to create

	* easy
	* shiny
	* human readable 
	* and good looking

	websites, by viewing my Markdown files through the [markdown.io](http://www.markdown.io) Markdown beautifier.

	Links can be created, i.e. check out this [link to google](http://www.google.com)

	Images are quite similiar to links, but with a leading ! before them:

	![An image of Neil Armstrong](img/first-man-on-moon.jpg "Neil Armstrong was the first man on the moon")


The above example will look like this:

Welcome!	
=======

Welcome visitor, this is my new website! I utilize *Markdown* to create

* easy
* shiny
* human readable 
* and good looking

websites, by viewing my Markdown files through the [markdown.io](http://www.markdown.io) Markdown beautifier.

Links can be created, i.e. check out this [link to google](http://www.google.com)

Images are quite similiar to links, but with a leading ! before them:

![An image of Neil Armstrong](img/first-man-on-moon.jpg "Neil Armstrong was the first man on the moon")

Publishing your file into the Web
---------------------------------

Creating the Markdown file wasn't to hard, was it? We will now need to put that file somewhere on web. The easiest way to do that, is to use a cloud storage provider like [Wuala](http://www.wuala.com) or [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com). If you don't have a cloud storage account, you can sign up for one, it's free! Else, you can of course use any other cloud storage provider or webspace.

With Dropbox, it is as easy as putting your markdown text file from above into your *Public* folder, right click on it and select "Get public link".

Making a website out of it
--------------------------

All you have to do then, is go to [the markdown.io website](http://www.markdown.io) and put that URL in the box and hit the "Go!" button.

Next steps
----------

* Learn the power of Markdown

Of course, this basic example uses only few features of Markdown. If you want to learn more about Markdown and it's syntax (it is easy, promised!), check out the [Syntax](syntax.txt) page.

* Customizing / Theming

When you get comfortable with the syntax, you might want to learn about how to use your own domain or how to create a custom-looking theme for your website. You can do this, check out the [Theming section](theming.txt).
